# Field Studies Council Centre Distance Calculator

This is proof-of-concept code that demonstrates use of the Google Maps API to calculate distances and travel times from a given location to all Field Studies Council learning locations (residential field centres, day centres, etc.).

This concept was inspired by a 2022 article in TES magazine: [Pupils ‘miss out’ on school trips as transport costs soar](https://archive.is/RpINB). The idea being if teachers are better able to assess travel times and distances, they will be able to more effectively justify school trips to our centres.

The code makes use of the following Maps APIs:

- [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix)
- [Distance Matrix Service client-side API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/distancematrix)
- [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding)
- [Geocoding Service client-side API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding)
